Great to see you're taking on this blockchain development task! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### 1. Understand the Requirements:

#### User Registration:
- **Smart Contract Design:**
  - Create a smart contract to add PayGizmo users to the blockchain.
  - Design it to accept data as arguments, as blockchains typically don't allow external data sources.
  - Record commercial information like wages and royalties.
- **Web Page:**
  - Build a web page to display added content and previous records.

#### Make Payment:
- **Smart Contract Design:**
  - Create a smart contract to pay outstanding funds for an asset.
  - Retrieve metadata and earnings from a PayGizmo database as arguments.
  - Extract information about participants, royalties, payment terms, advance payments, and balances.
  - Check if participants can be paid according to contract terms.
  - Send relevant payments to participants' wallets.

### 2. Plan Your Approach:

- **Data Flow:**
  - Understand how data will be retrieved from PayGizmo databases and fed to the blockchain.
  - Plan how data will be read from the blockchain and displayed in PayGizmo using JSON format.

- **Documentation:**
  - Prepare a comprehensive README documenting all steps for deployment and usage.
  - Include information on any scheduled tasks or triggered actions.

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment:

- **Blockchain Platform:**
  - Choose the blockchain platform you'll be working on (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).
  - Set up a development environment for smart contract development.

- **Web Development:**
  - Set up a web development environment for building the display page.

### 4. Start Coding:

#### User Registration:

1. **Smart Contract:**
   - Write a smart contract that adds PayGizmo users.
   - Include functions to record commercial information.
   - Make sure it accepts external data as arguments.

2. **Web Page:**
   - Develop a web page to interact with the smart contract.
   - Display added content and previous records.

#### Make Payment:

1. **Smart Contract:**
   - Write a smart contract for making payments.
   - Retrieve metadata and earnings from PayGizmo databases.
   - Implement logic to calculate payments based on contract terms.
   - Send payments to participants' wallets.

### 5. Testing:

- Test your smart contracts thoroughly.
- Ensure data flow between PayGizmo and the blockchain works as intended.
- Test the web page for displaying content.

### 6. Documentation:

- Update the README with clear instructions for deployment and usage.
- Include information on any scheduled tasks or triggered actions.

### 7. Deployment:

- Deploy your smart contracts on the chosen blockchain platform.
- Ensure the web page is accessible and displays data correctly.

### 8. Integration:

- Integrate your blockchain solution with PayGizmo, ensuring seamless data flow.

### 9. Review and Iterate:

- Review your code, documentation, and integration.
- Iterate based on feedback and make necessary improvements.

### 10. Finalize:

- Ensure everything is working as expected.
- Provide documentation and training if necessary.

Remember to communicate regularly with your team and seek feedback throughout the development process. Good luck with your blockchain development tasks!
